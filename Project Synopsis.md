### MediKnowledge - Know your Medicine

**Problem Statement/Opportunity**
There are many Patients and daily people taking all kinds of medicine without knowing why and what they are taking.
And there are many confusing similar name medicine, we know them as one but they are different.
Many sites may provide info on them but they provide so much info that may not be necessary to the client.
The client may need to read 1 or 2 web-page to get an answer for “what to do if I miss a dose?” which is 1- line answer.
The client doesn’t even get an answer sometimes with hours of reading a document. This website will give a short yet descriptive answer to most information about each medicine.
It also will hold a QnA bot to answer queries anytime. The client will have an easy time finding the info they need.

**Project Description**
The main idea is to provide the answer to the client's most asked questions about medicine.
The info includes general questions on medicine and info about many medicines as individuals, it also includes some disease-related information.
This website is for that client who wants access to this information. And address the problem of the lack of knowledge in them. The QnA bot will be a quick way to find answers.
The SQL database will hold all the details of medicine.
QnA feature will deal with questions like “I'm feeling better. Is it okay to stop taking my medicine?”, “Can Ivermectin be used to treat COVID-19?” like many queries.
This will solve the lack of knowledge of medicine of the client. The website will give a name list of medicines or the search-bar option to search for a particular medicine.
Detail include uses, side-effects, when to take, what if u miss? , with many basic info which users usually ask. This will increase the user interaction of their medicine.
It aims to provide a better understanding about what & why we take them every day.
